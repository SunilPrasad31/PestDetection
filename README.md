# PEST-DETECTION-IN-AGRICULTURAL-FIELD

 # INTRODUCTION
   
Pest infestation represents a significant threat to agricultural fields, causing
substantial damage to food crops. To combat this challenge, farmers often resort
to the use of pesticides. However, the excessive application of these chemicals has
raised concerns for the environment and human health. Pesticides have been
linked to various health disorders, including asthma, eye and respiratory tract
irritation, and skin cancer. Acknowledging the need for a more sustainable and
accurate approach to pest control, the field of agriculture science is integrating
image analysis techniques. Although current systems exist, their accuracy
frequently falls short, necessitating advancements. Our project's goal is to enhance
the precision of pest detection by leveraging cutting-edge machine learning
algorithms like enhanced YOLO v5. By doing so, we aim to revolutionize crop
management, minimize pesticide usage, and bolster overall crop production while
addressing the limitations of existing methods. This initiative not only safeguards
the environment and human health but also represents a significant stride towards
sustainable and efficient pest management in agriculture.
