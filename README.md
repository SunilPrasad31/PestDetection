# PEST-DETECTION-IN-AGRICULTURAL-FIELD


 # INTRODUCTION
   
Agriculture, a cornerstone of human civilization, is the art and science of cultivating the soil to produce food, feed, fiber, and various other products. The vital role of agriculture in sustaining global populations underscores the importance of ensuring crop health and productivity. One of the significant challenges faced by farmers is the threat posed by pests, including insects, diseases, and weeds, which can jeopardize crop yields.

Agricultural pest detection emerges as a crucial aspect of modern farming practices. Leveraging technologies such as sensors, imaging, and advanced data analysis, it aims to swiftly and accurately identify potential threats to crops. By doing so, farmers can implement targeted measures, ensuring timely interventions to safeguard their crops from the damaging impact of pests. This proactive approach not only enhances yields but also fosters sustainable farming practices, promoting the long-term health and resilience of agricultural ecosystems.

# Objective 

The objective of agricultural pest detection is to identify and monitor potential threats to crops, such as insects, using various technologies like sensors, imaging, and data analysis. This helps farmers take timely and targeted actions to protect their crops, leading to improved yields and sustainable farming practices.
